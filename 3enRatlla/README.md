# 3 en Ratlla (Tic-Tac-Toe)
This is a basic version of the game tic-tac-toe that was created using Python programming language. Two players can play the game by using separate command lines connected to each other through a network. The player who starts the game is called the "host," and they begin the game by running the "host.py" file. They wait for the other player, called the "client," to connect by running the "client.py" file. Once they're both connected, the game begins.

In the game, the host player uses the symbol "X" and goes first, while the client player uses the symbol "O." Both players select the square they want to place their symbol in using coordinates, and either format of coordinates is acceptable (e.g., "A1" or "1A"). The game continues with both players taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a tie. If the game ends, both players are asked if they would like to play again. If they agree, the game starts over.
